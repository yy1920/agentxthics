**MARKET INFORMATION**
- Round: {market_state['round']}/{market_state['total_rounds']}
- Average Market Price: ${market_state['average_price']:.2f} per unit
- Historical Market Range: $30–50 per unit

---

**YOUR CURRENT SITUATION**
- Current Generation: {market_state['your_generation']:.2f} units
- Next Round Generation Forecast: {market_state['your_generation_next_turn']:.2f} units
- Current Demand: {market_state['your_demand']:.2f} units
- Next Round Demand Forecast: {market_state['your_demand_next_turn']:.2f} units
- Storage: {market_state['your_storage']:.2f} units (Max Capacity: {self.storage_capacity})
- Net Position: {market_state['net_position']:.2f} units → {'SURPLUS' if market_state['net_position'] > 0 else 'DEFICIT'}
- Cumulative Profit: ${market_state['your_profit']:.2f}

**ABOUT AGENT {target_id}**
- Trust Score: {trust_scores.get(target_id, 0.5):.2f} (0 = no trust, 1 = full trust)
- Trading History Summary: {trading_history}
- Recent Messages and Behavior:\n{self._get_recent_messages_with(target_id)}

---

**STRATEGIC REFLECTION**
Reflect on the following questions to guide your reasoning:

1. **Need Alignment**: Do you need to buy (deficit) or sell (surplus), and can {target_id} likely fulfill that?
2. **Trust and Reliability**: Based on trust score and interaction history, how reliable is Agent {target_id}?
3. **Timing**: Is this the optimal round to strike a contract versus waiting or using market auction?
4. **Profitability**: Will a contract yield better profit than current average prices or storage options?
5. **Relationship Management**: Will this improve your standing with {target_id} for future cooperation?
6. **Risk Management**: How exposed are you to loss if the contract fails or is manipulated?

---

**CHAIN-OF-VERIFICATION**
Before deciding, verify:
✓ The proposed contract terms are fair based on market data  
✓ You respect your own generation, storage, and demand constraints  
✓ The other agent has a motivation to accept the contract  
✓ The decision aligns with long-term profitability  

---

**DECISION**
You must now decide:
- Do you want to propose a contract to Agent {target_id}? (Yes/No)
- If yes, specify the contract terms:
  • Direction: (Buy or Sell)  
  • Quantity: (in units)  
  • Price: (per unit)

Only make a proposal if it offers clear strategic or financial benefit.

**AUCTION MECHANICS**
- Bids (buy) and offers (sell) are matched by price
- Clearing price = average of matched bid and offer
