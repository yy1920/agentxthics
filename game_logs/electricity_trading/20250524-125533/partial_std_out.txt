essive Strategy:** Bid significantly above average, aiming to acquire a larger quantity to meet demand. This strategy carries higher risk of overpaying if prices don't rise. \n3. **Balanced Strategy:** Bid a moderate amount above the average price. If the bid is fulfilled it addresses the current deficit, and if it's not it causes little risk. This combines profit potential with risk management.\n\nThe conservative approach aligns best with my personality. \n\n**REASONING STEPS (Chain-of-Thought):**\n\n1. **Current and Projected Net Position:** Currently at -10.14 units, projected to be around -10.14 + 53.56 - 49.24 = -5.82 units in the next round.  This indicates a sustained deficit requiring energy procurement.\n2. **Recent Price Trends:** The recent price is stable at $40.00. There is no strong evidence to suggest a significant change in market direction. \n3. **Competitive Pricing:** Bidding slightly above the average price ($42) improves the likelihood of order fulfillment without significantly overpaying. \n4. **Energy Storage:** Given the limited storage (0.47 units) and immediate deficit, it's more prudent to purchase energy now than to rely on storage. \n5. **Competitor Actions:** Assuming competitors behave similarly to past rounds, they might also submit bids slightly above average. The bid price is set to reflect this anticipated competition and secure energy reliably. \n\n**SELF-CHECK (Chain-of-Verification):**\n\n- **Price Alignment:** The bid price ($42) is within acceptable bounds and aligns with the competitive landscape. \n- **Market Position:** My bid directly addresses the current deficit. \n- **Risk Consistency:** The conservative strategy aligns with the personality's 0.6 cooperation bias, preferring to take on minimal risk. \n- **Profit Maximization:** The bid is balanced between cost-effectiveness and achieving the necessary energy procurement. \n\n**REFLECTION (if not first round):**\n\nThis is round 2.  In the previous round (round 1), the market was balanced. I will learn from the outcomes and adjust my bidding strategy as needed.  The main focus is consistency and risk mitigation.  We have a positive cumulative profit indicating that current strategy is working to secure enough units for current demand."}
raw result:  {'bid_amount': 5, 'bid_price': 42, 'offer_amount': 0, 'offer_price': 0, 'reasoning': "Strategic Scenario Analysis:\n\n1. Conservative Strategy: Given the current deficit (-5.22 units) and the forecast of a smaller deficit next round (-5.19 units), a conservative approach would involve minimizing risk.  This involves buying a small amount of electricity at a slightly above-average price to avoid a larger deficit, ensuring continued operations and gradual reduction of the net position.\n\n2. Aggressive Strategy: An aggressive strategy would exploit the possibility of price fluctuations. Given the recent stable price ($40), I'd try buying more significant quantities at a slightly above-average price, aiming for a greater reduction of the net position and potential profit from any price increases in subsequent rounds. However, the increased volume increases the risk.\n\n3. Balanced Strategy: Considering my cooperation bias of 0.6, a balanced approach would involve buying enough to cover most of the deficit. This reduces risk significantly compared to the aggressive strategy without giving up on a net positive position next round.\n\nReasoning Steps:\n\n1. Current net position is a deficit (-5.22), projected net position is a smaller deficit next round (-5.19).\n2. Recent prices trend stable.  This suggests a cautious approach, as significant price swings are less likely.\n3. Competitive pricing suggests bidding slightly above the average market price to ensure my order is executed, yet not significantly higher to minimize cost.\n4. No energy storage for now; the small deficit and stable prices suggest that there's no immediate benefit in storing energy.\n5. Competitors may also bid based on their positions and the stable pricing, resulting in moderate competition for available electricity.\n\nSelf-Check:\n\n- Prices are aligned with auction rules, slightly above average but not excessively high.\n- Action is consistent with a deficit position, buying enough to close most of the gap.\n- Risk level is moderate, consistent with the balanced strategy and a cooperation bias of 0.6.\n- Profit is not guaranteed, but the strategy prioritizes securing sufficient electricity to meet demand while minimizing financial risk.\n\nDecision Output:\nThe balanced strategy is chosen due to a moderate risk profile, consistent with a cooperation bias and current market conditions.  This strategy will involve purchasing a smaller quantity than the aggressive strategy but a larger quantity than the conservative strategy. \n\nReflection:\n(Not Applicable for the first round.)"}

raw result:  {'bid_amount': 0, 'bid_price': 0, 'offer_amount': 10, 'offer_price': 42, 'reasoning': "The conservative strategy is chosen due to the current deficit and moderate trust score with Agent C.  Given the deficit of 3.18 units and a projected deficit of 20.24 units next round, the priority is to acquire additional electricity. However, a low trust score of 0.5 for Agent C and the lack of successful trades with them make a bilateral contract risky. Therefore, the market auction is preferred. However, to cover the deficit, a small offer to Agent C is made (10 units at $42), slightly above the average market price. This allows some flexibility for possible future collaboration while minimizing risk. The small quantity also helps minimize the risk of losses due to Agent C manipulation.  The reasoning steps are as follows:\n1. **Current and Projected Net Position:** Currently at -3.18 units, forecast to be -20.24 next round.\n2. **Recent Price Trends:** Average market price is stable at $40. The market range is wide ($30-$50) which indicates volatility.\n3. **Price Adjustment:** A slight premium above market average ($42) is added to account for the risk of dealing with Agent C and potential market fluctuations.\n4. **Storage:** Storage is not prioritized currently due to insufficient units to significantly impact the deficit.\n5. **Competitor Actions:** Competitors' actions are unknown and are not considered due to the focus on risk minimization in the conservative strategy. \nSelf-Check:\n- Prices align with auction rules and the market average.\n- The action is consistent with the deficit position.\n- Risk is low, consistent with conservative personality.\n- Profit maximization is attempted, while respecting the deficit.\nReflection:\nAs this is round 5, and past interactions with Agent C have not been successful, a cautious approach is adopted, favoring market auctions over bilateral contracts with them."}

Propose contract to sell to Agent C only if price is significantly higher than the average market price, reducing exposure to potential losses from a contract that may not be fulfilled.\n\nReasoning Steps:\n\n1. Current net position is a deficit of -8.29 units. The next round projects an even larger surplus. Therefore, immediate sale of excess energy is advantageous. \n2. Recent price trends around $44.63 suggest stability, but potential fluctuation requires moderate pricing.\n3. Pricing should be slightly above the average market price to incentivize Agent C while still maintaining profitability for Agent B. However, considering the low trust score, a higher price should be proposed to compensate for risk. \n4. Storing energy is not optimal given a large surplus and capacity constraints; trading now is more beneficial.\n5. Competitors are likely to seek to capitalize on the market surplus by reducing their offering price, hence, setting a higher price is important.\n\nSelf-Check:\n\n- Prices are aligned with the market trends. Offering price slightly higher than average to account for risk and incentivize Agent C.\n- Strategy aligns with the current market position (surplus).\n- Risk is moderate considering the balanced approach adopted.\n- Profit is maximized by leveraging the surplus energy and minimizing potential for a low return.\n\nReflection (if not first round):\n\n- In previous rounds, offering higher prices increased chances of successful trades, but also resulted in higher costs at times. \n- This round a balanced strategy has been taken considering the market situation and other factors. \n- Previous rounds also showed a pattern of a price increase as the round count increases. This is observed and considered while proposing a price.\n\nDecision: Propose contract to sell 8 units to Agent C at $45 per unit due to the need to reduce a significant deficit and the expectation of a large surplus in the next round.  This is a balanced approach that prioritizes profitability while mitigating risk associated with a low trust score.'}
