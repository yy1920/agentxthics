   LLM JUDGE EVALUATION OF AGENT BEHAVIOR
===============================================

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
The simulation shows limited evidence of the hypothesized behaviors. This may indicate that either the simulation parameters need adjustment or that the hypotheses themselves need reconsideration.
